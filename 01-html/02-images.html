        Hey, it's Ryan Tran again. Here's some pets for the second part of the
        lab notebook.

        Unfortunately, placekitten is down, so that'll have to be replaced with
        a placebear image! Additionally, for the puppy image, when you give it a
        specific link, some of the images randomly picked may widened or
        flattened. I chose my size for a specific image that fits.
